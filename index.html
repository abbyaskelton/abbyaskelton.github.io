    <h2 id="whatisglobalwarming"> What is global warming? </h2>
    <p> Often, 'global warming' and 'climate change' are used interchangably, and though they are similar, they are different. Global warming is the warming of Earth caused by human actions, and climate change is the warming of Earth caused by human action and natural factors.
    <h2 id="whatisglobalwarming"> Who and what does global warming affect? </h2>
    <p> Though global warming ultimately affects everyone on Earth, it primarily affects the lower class, as they do not have the money and resources to protect themselves from harmful effects. Global warming also majorly affects people who live near oceans, as water levels are rapidly rising. Many people will be displaced from increasing water levels and will be left without homes. The majority of coral reefs and more than half of plants and animals will die from a small amount of global warming.</p>
