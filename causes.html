    <h2 id="whatisglobalwarming">Greenhouse Effect</h2>
    <p>One large factor of global warming is the Greenhouse Effect, which is the trapping of heat from the Sun in Earth's atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and methane, make it much more difficult for the extra heat to escape. Though these gases can be produced naturally, much of them are produced by humans through burning fossil fuels, clearing land, and other activities. Though everyday-people things, like driving cars, do release greenhouse gasses, the majority are released by big corporations and their factories, which is why it is so important to regulate them.</p>

    <h2 id="whatisglobalwarming">Deforestation</h2>
    <p>Another cause of global warming is deforestation. Often, forests are cleared so that land can be used for agricultural, industrial, and residential purposes. Plants absorb lots of carbon dioxide and in turn release oxygen, so destroying these forests means that carbon dioxide has no where to go but our air. Also, when these trees and other plants are removed, all the carbon dioxide they were storing gets released back into the air.</p>

    <h2 id="whatisglobalwarming">Livestock</h2>
    <p>Livestock can also contribute to greenhouse gas emmisions. When they graze, they release lots of methane into the air. Cows have multi-chambered stomaches, which use certain microbes to digest their food. This process creates methane, which gets released when the cows burb. One or two cows don't seem like much, but considering there are nearly one billion cows in the world, this is a much bigger deal.  </p>
